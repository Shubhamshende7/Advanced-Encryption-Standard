# Advanced-Encryption-Standard

[ABOUT THE PROJECT] 
This project is for implementing the AES Encryption to securely transfer files from sender to receiver It will make use of RSA and AES modes of Encryption and Decryption. The system will monitor the run times of the functions. Data will be sent by socket connection between two systems on a network.

CONTROL FLOW
1. RSA Encryption will secure connnection for data transfer.
